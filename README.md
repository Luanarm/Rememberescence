# Rememberescence

## Inspiration
The theme of "nostalgia" reminded us of the cherished memories of our childhood. Reflecting on those moments, we realized that our recollections often unfold like stories. This led us to wonder if we could recreate that storytelling experience for others, offering them a journey that resonates with their past and the innocence of childhood. Inspired by this, we decided to create an interactive experience that serves as more than just a product but as a portal to the wistful realms of nostalgia. 

## What it does
This web app will take the user input such as age, location, interests and friends and create a nostalgic short story, bringing them back to the innocence, wonder and happiness of childhood. 

## How we built it
We decided to use Co:here's Generate API to create the story based on user inputs. The backend is run using Flask and the frontend is built using Tailwind CSS. 

## Challenges we ran into
We were initially planning to implement a personalized Spotify playlist based on the user input to go along with the immersive experience of reading the curated story. We faced issues with implementing the Spotify API and decided not to use the API anymore. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our web app successfully creates a personalized story based on the user inputs and also fitting to the nostalgia theme.

## What we learned
We learned how to work with an AI API. We also improved our skills in Flask and Tailwind CSS. 

## What's next for Rememberescence
Hopefully, users will be able to login and create multiple story experiences based on different inputs and be able to access them all.
